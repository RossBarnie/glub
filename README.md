# Gitlab command-line client

This is a Gitlab command-line client. It's still very early in development. So far, you can create projects, and that's it.

Dependencies:

* [Thor](http://whatisthor.com)
* [Rest Client](http://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client)

## TODOs

This is very much an early release, that'll be getting added to frequently.

Coming soon:

* More control over project creation
* It'll be a Gem
