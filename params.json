{"name":"Glub","tagline":"A command-line client into the Gitlab API","body":"# Gitlab command-line client\r\n\r\nThis is a Gitlab command-line client. It's still very early in development. So far, you can create projects, and that's it.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\n* [Thor](http://whatisthor.com)\r\n* [Rest Client](http://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\ngem install glub\r\n\r\n## Config\r\n\r\nYou will need a file called .gitlab in your home directory. It's a YAML file. \r\n\r\nYou can get your API key - also known as private token - from your account page on Gitlab\r\n\r\n### Config example\r\n\r\n    api_endpoint:   http://gitlab.mycompany.com/api/v3\r\n    api_key     :   Kd834fh3ofoaal\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\nNothing. Nobody's asked me anything about it. \r\n\r\n## Questions I'm going to answer anyway, whether anyone asks them or not\r\n\r\n* **Why did you create this?** - I had to check in a lot of little projects to a local Gitlab repo, and I'm lazy\r\n* **Why is it called glub?**   - The *gl* bit stands for GitLab, obviously, and glub is just a short word that starts with that. \r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n\r\nThis is very much an early release, that'll be getting added to frequently.\r\n\r\nComing soon:\r\n\r\n* More control over project creation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nThis is released under the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) licence.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
